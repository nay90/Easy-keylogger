# Easy-keylogger
This Key Logger has a low Detection rate. its low because it does not send you an email, when running it can be found in Task Manger as "DellServices" it save's the keylog file in C:/ProgarmData
As "Dellsupport.txt" if you wish to extract from a victims' Computer you would need back door access. if extracting Delete the file from the victims Computer as it will just build up over time.
